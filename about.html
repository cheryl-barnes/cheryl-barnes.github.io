<span style="font-size: 1.25em; color: #190CA8;"> ABOUT ME </span>
<p> I am originally from California and moved to Alaska in January 2015 (first Juneau, then Sitka, and now Anchorage). Among my favorite aspects of the 'last frontier' are 1) incredible access to wild spaces, 2) unbeatable sunsets and ski lines, 3) regular eagle, porcupine, bear, moose, and whale sightings, 4) super long summer days, and 5) a plethora of snow activities in winter. I also love to snorkel, SCUBA dive, hike, camp, and travel as much as I can get away with. When not processing fish, analyzing data, or adventuring, I enjoy spending time at home with my partner and two cats. <br>

<strong> <br>Academics</strong>: I earned a BS in biology from <a href="http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/" target="_blank">San Diego State University</a>, an MS in marine science from <a href="https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/" target="_blank">Moss Landing Marine Laboratories</a>, and a PhD in fisheries from <a href="https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/" target="_blank">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a>. I have also served as a program and outreach director in the nonprofit sector, program representative for <a href="https://caseagrant.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">California Sea Grant</a>, and lead scientist for the <a href="https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/ccfrp/" target="_blank">California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program</a>. I am now a postdoctoral researcher with NOAA Fisheries and the University of Washington through the <a href="https://jisao.uw.edu/research/" target="_blank">Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO)</a>. <br><br>
	
My academic and professional experiences include: marine science education and outreach, field- and lab-based process research, and using broad-scale survey data to make ecological inferences in nearshore systems. I am most interested in conducting scientific research that enhances our understanding about the biology and ecology of harvested stocks, thereby supporting sustainable fisheries management. <br><br>
		
Apart from fish, I am passionate about enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in science. And...I wholeheartedly believe in the power of visibility. I am a first generation college student from a working class family and identify as queer. I strive to bring my authentic self into my work, acknowledge my own implicit biases, and support other underrepresented minorities in my field.
