<p> Originally from California, I moved to Alaska in January 2015 (first Juneau, then Sitka, and now Anchorage). Among my favorite aspects of living in the 'last frontier' are 1) incredible access to wild spaces, 2) unbeatable sunsets and skilines, 3) regular eagle, porcupine, moose, and whale sightings, 4) extremely long summer days, and 5) the plethora of snow activities in winter. I also love to snorkel, SCUBA dive, hike, camp, and travel.
			
<p> I earned a BS in biology from <a href="http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/">San Diego State University</a>, an MS in marine science from <a href="https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/">Moss Landing Marine Laboratories</a>, and a PhD in fisheries from <a href="https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a>. I have also served as a program and outreach director in the nonprofit sector, program representative for <a href="https://caseagrant.ucsd.edu/">California Sea Grant</a>, and lead scientist for the <a href="https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/ccfrp/">California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program</a>. I am most interested in conducting scientific research that enhances our understanding about the biology and ecology of harvested stocks, thereby supporting sustainable fisheries management. My academic and professional experiences include: marine science education and outreach, field- and lab-based process research, and using broad-scale survey data to make ecological inferences in nearshore systems.</p>
		
<p> Finally, I am passionate about enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in science and wholeheartedly believe in the power of visibility. I am a cis woman, first generation college student from a working class family, identify as queer, and strive to be an ally to other underrepresented minorities in my field.
