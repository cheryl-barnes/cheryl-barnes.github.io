Countless fishers, resource managers, and volunteers have also greatly contributed to our understanding of groundfish dynamics in the North Pacific.

Cheryl and the IMF Lab conduct collaborative scientific research to improve our understanding about the population and community dynamics of marine species &mdash; with a focus on groundfish. Individual projects are specifically designed to inform stock assessments and support ecosystem-based fisheries management. We emphasize the value of transdisciplinary collaborations among scientists, managers, and fishery stakeholders because of its benefit to both product and process.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/madisonbargas/" target="_blank">Madison</a> is originally from the Bay Area in California and moved to Juneau, Alaska in 2014. She graduated from the <a href="https://uas.alaska.edu/index.html" target="_blank">University of Alaska Southeast</a> in 2019 with a BS in marine biology and a minor in environmental science. After graduation, Madison worked with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) to conduct stream surveys of juvenile Coho salmon. She subsequently transitioned to working as a biologist for ADFG's Commercial Groundfish Project. Madison is currently working on an <b>MS</b> in fisheries science at OSU. Her thesis research involves quantifying spatial variation in black rockfish (<i>Sebastes melanops</i>) life history traits to inform state-based stock assessments in the California Current and Gulf of Alaska. Apart from working with fish, Madison enjoys hiking, bike rides, traveling, and hanging out with her old lady pug, Sophie.

<span style="font-size: 1em; color: #190CA8; font-weight: bold;"> Interested in undergraduate research opportunities? </span> <br>
<span style="color: #7A122C">
<!---Undergraduate students in the IMF Lab engage in research activities that promote the development of technical skills used in marine fisheries science. These involve conducting literature reviews, portside sampling, participating in at sea surveys, dissecting fish, collecting biological data in the laboratory, managing scientific databases, performing statistical analyses, and/or ecological modeling. <br><br> --->
Our group is committed to holistic mentoring that provides effective training for scholarly research and promotes individualized growth. We work to create an environment that is accessible, equitable, intellectually stimulating, safe, emotionally supportive, and free from harassment of any kind. We encourage critical thinking, skepticism, and creativity. We help plan and direct student research activities by setting reasonable and attainable goals and establishing appropriate timelines for successful completion. We also meet with students on a regular basis to answer questions, discuss progress, and provide resources for professional development. 
	<br><br>	
Prospective students should be motivated to develop the practical skills that are needed for successful research on marine fish species. They should also be organized, detail-oriented, and interested in upholding standardized data collection protocols. We prioritize potential over experience to promote skill development and self confidence in undergraduate students that have not yet had opportunities to participate in scientific research. A keen interest in marine biology and/or ecology is desired.
